# Description of the data and file structure

Fig1-data_FieldL_inactivation_NCM_firingrates.csv: Data associated with Figure 1. Columns include: Timecourse of the experiment (PRE = pre-infusion, POST = post-infusion, and numbers indicate time in minutes post infusion); Trial number (auditory playback trial number); Period (for each auditory stimulus trial, firing rates were calculated during a baseline period prior to stimulus presentation, and then during stimulus presentation); FiringRate_Hz (firing rate in hertz, or spikes per second); Stimulus_name (name of the auditory stimulus).

Fig3-4-data_Egr-1_cellcounts_behavior.csv: Data associated with Figures 3 and 4. Columns include: Bird_ID (unique identifier for each animal in the study); Treatment (playback treatment type, followed by drug infusion type); song_tx (playback treatment type); drug_tx (drug infusion type); columns with "egr1" (mean cell counts in brain regions for which egr1 was quantified); all other columns indicate behaviors quantified for the study, and proportions indicate proportions of behaviors quantified during auditory playback compared to total behaviors quantified. "NA" data represents missing data.

Fig5-data_VMHl_Wilcox_responsestrength.csv: Data associated with Figure 5. Columns include: Unit_ID (unique identifier for each signle unit); Bird_ID (unique identifier for each animal in the study); Hemisphere that single units were recorded from (Lhem = left hemisphere; Rhem = right hemisphere); Trial (auditory playback trial identifier); Unit_letter (Single units recorded at the same site in the same trial are given different letters for identification purposes); Stimulus (auditory stimulus presented during the corresponding trial); p.value (p value of the Wilcox test used to determine whether a single unit responded with higher numbers of action potentials during the stimulus period compared to the baseline period).

Fig5-data_VMHl_classifier_rcorr_accuracy_clean.csv: Data associated with Figure 5. Columns include: Unit (unique identifier for each signle unit); Bird_ID (unique identifier for each animal in the study); Hemisphere that single units were recorded from (Lhem = left hemisphere; Rhem = right hemisphere); Track (Denotes trials conducted earlier or later in a recording session for a given animal); Depth (identifying information for trials, which were conducted at different sites); Unit_letter (Single units recorded at the same site in the same trial are given different letters for identification purposes); Method (rcorr = the rcorr input to the pattern classifier as opposed to other classification methods); Accuracy (unitless metric of how accurate classifier was at classifying the data); Stimulus (auditory stimulus presented).

Fig5-data_VMHl_firing_rates.csv: Data associated with Figure 5. Columns include: Unit (unique identifier for each signle unit); Bird_ID (unique identifier for each animal in the study); Hemisphere that single units were recorded from (Lhem = left hemisphere; Rhem = right hemisphere); Track (Prefix "T1" or "T2" denotes trials conducted earlier or later in a recording session for a given animal; numerical suffix denotes an arbitrary depth of recording that identifies information for trials, which were conducted at different sites); Unit_letter (Single units recorded at the same site in the same trial are given different letters for identification purposes); Stimulus (auditory stimulus presented during the corresponding trial); Trial (auditory playback trial identifier); Period (for each auditory stimulus trial, firing rates were calculated during a baseline period prior to stimulus presentation, and then during stimulus presentation); FR_Hz (firing rate in hertz, or spikes per second).
